<a name="usage"></a>

The `Laravel-User-Monitoring`, need to use middleware, traits, etc ... and it's not hard, enjoys :)

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

<a name="routes-configuration"></a>
## Routes Configuration

If you want to customize the routes, you can publish the route file with this command:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-user-monitoring-routes"
```

After, you can go to the `routes/user-monitoring.php` file and customize the routes.

Also, if you want to change the route file name, you can go to the config file and change the `file_path`:

```php
/*
 * Configurations.
 */
'config' => [
    'routes' => [
        'file_path' => 'routes/user-monitoring.php',
    ],
],
```

<a name="user-configuration"></a>
## User Configuration

You can config your user with the `user-monitoring.php` configuration file:

```php
'user' => [
    /*
     * User model.
     */
    'model' => 'App\Models\User',

    /*
     * Foreign Key column name.
     */
    'foreign_key' => 'user_id',

    /*
     * Users table name.
     */
    'table' => 'users',

    /*
     * The correct guard.
     */
    'guard' => 'web',

    /*
     * If you are using uuid or ulid you can change it for the type of foreign_key.
     *
     * When you are using ulid or uuid, you need to add related traits into the models.
     */
    'foreign_key_type' => 'id', // uuid, ulid, id
],
```

- `model`: If your user model exists in another place, you can change it to the correct namespace.
- `foreign_key`: You can set the user foreign_key name, like `customer_id`.
- `table`: You can write your users table name if is not `users.
- `guard`: The correct guard that using for the user.

<a name="foreign-key-type-uuid-ulid-id"></a>
### Foreign Key Type (UUID, ULID, ID)

If you are using `uuid` or `ulid`, you can change `foreign_key_type` to your correct foreign key type:

```php
'user' => [
    ...

    /*
     * If you are using uuid or ulid you can change it for the type of foreign_key.
     *
     * When you are using ulid or uuid, you need to add related traits into the models.
     */
    'foreign_key_type' => 'uuid', // uuid, ulid, id
],
```

> **_NOTE:_**  You must write `uuid` or `ulid` or `id`.

<a name="visit-monitoring"></a>
## Visit Monitoring

When you want to monitor all views of your application, you must follow below:

1. Publish the [Migrations](#publish)

2. Use `VisitMonitoringMiddleware` in Kernel.php, you can go to the `App/Http` folder and open the `Kernel.php` file and add `VisitMonitoringMiddleware` into your middleware for example:
```php
protected $middlewareGroups = [
    'web' => [
        ...
        \Binafy\LaravelUserMonitoring\Middlewares\VisitMonitoringMiddleware::class,
    ],

    'api' => [
        // \Laravel\Sanctum\Http\Middleware\EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful::class,
        \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests::class.':api',
        \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\SubstituteBindings::class,
    ],
];
```

After, you can see all pages monitoring :)

If you want to disable monitoring for specific pages you can go to `user-monitoring.php` that exists in the `config` folder and add pages into the `visit_monitoring` key:

```php
'visit_monitoring' => [
    /*
     * You can specify pages not to be monitored.
     */
    'except_pages' => [
        'home',
        'admin/dashboard',
    ],
],
```

<a name="delete-visit-monitoring-records-by-specific-days"></a>
### Delete Visit Monitoring Records By Specific Days

You may delete records by specific days, Laravel-User-Monitoring also supports this 🤩.

First, you need to go to the `user-monitoring` config file and highlight the days that you want to delete:

```php
'visit_monitoring' => [
    ...

    /*
     * If you want to delete visit rows after some days, you can change this to 360,
     * but if you don't like to delete rows you can change it to 0.
     *
     * For this feature you need Task-Scheduling => https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling
     */
    'delete_days' => 10,
],
```

After, you need to use [Task Scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling) to fire-related command, so go to `app/Console/Kernel.php` and do like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Console;

...
use Binafy\LaravelUserMonitoring\Commands\RemoveVisitMonitoringRecordsCommand;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    /**
     * Define the application's command schedule.
     */
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule): void
    {
         $schedule->command(RemoveVisitMonitoringRecordsCommand::class)->hourly();
    }
}
```

You can change `hourly` to `minute` or `second`, for more information you can read [Schedule Frequency Options](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling#schedule-frequency-options).

<a name="turn-on-off"></a>
### Turn ON-OFF

Maybe you want to turn off visit monitoring for somedays or always, you can use configuration to turn it off:

```php
'visit_monitoring' => [
    ...

    /*
     * If you want to disable visit monitoring, you can change it to false.
     */
    'turn_on' => true,
    
    ...
]
```

<a name="visit-monitoring-views"></a>
### Visit Monitoring Views

Laravel-User-Monitoring also has an amazing views that you can use it very easy, just need to go to `/user-monitoring/visits-monitoring` url, and enjoy:

![Visit Monitoring Preview](/art/visits-monitoring/preview.png "Visit Monitoring")

<a name="ajax-requests"></a>
### Ajax Requests

Maybe you may disable record visits for `Ajax` requests, you can use config to disable it:

```php
 'visit_monitoring' => [
        ...

        /*
         * If you want to disable visit monitoring in Ajax mode, set it to false.
         */
        'ajax_requests' => true,

        ...
    ],
```

When set to false, Ajax requests will not be recorded.

<a name="action-monitoring"></a>
## Action Monitoring

If you want to monitor your models actions, you can use the `Actionable` trait in your model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Binafy\LaravelUserMonitoring\Traits\Actionable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Product extends Model
{
    use Actionable;
}
```

Now when a product is read, created, updated, or deleted, you can see which users doing that.

If you want to disable some actions like created, you can use the config file:

```php
'action_monitoring' => [
    ...
    
    /*
     * Monitor actions.
     *
     * You can set true/false for monitor actions like (store, update, and ...).
     */
    'on_store'      => false,
    'on_update'     => true,
    'on_destroy'    => true,
    'on_read'       => true,
    'on_restore'    => false,
    'on_replicate'  => false,
],
```

## Authentication Monitoring

Have you ever thought about monitoring the entry and exit of users of your application? Now you can :) <br>
If you want to monitor users when logging in or logout of your application, you need to migrate the migrations to the config file and change true for monitoring authentication.

```php
'authentication_monitoring' => [
    ...

    /*
     * You can set true/false for monitor login or logout. 
     */
    'on_login' => true,
